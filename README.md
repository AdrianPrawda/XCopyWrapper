# XCopyWrapper

Small wrapper for xcopy.exe

Copies files and directories into a backup directory while preserving the copied files' directory structure.

## Usage

 Drag-and-drop files or directories on the executable. A backup directory (./root) will automatically be created if it doesn't exist.
 **Don't close the terminal that opens** as user input is occasionally required.

## Motivation

Created to make simple, selective file / directory backups a bit easier to handle.
It's very, very simple by design.
